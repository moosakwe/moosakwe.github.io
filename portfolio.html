						<div class="descample">With the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requiring many companies to be more transparent about their terms and conditions and data use, the past two months brought a deluge of announcements regarding changes to the policies of many popular services.

						<div class="descample">On the heels of global outrage regarding the Cambridge Analytical scandal, Mark Zuckerberg testified this week before Congress over the course of two days in two very long sessions. Given the scope of Facebook&#8217;s business, the sessions covered a wide range of topics, from manipulative ads and censorship to the presence of illicit materials on Facebook&#8217;s network. While there&#8217;s a lot to unpack, we&#8217;re zeroing in on the key aspects of Zuckerberg&#8217;s testimony and detailing what may be in Facebook&#8217;s future.</div>

						<hr>
						<div class="descample">2018 has been a turning point in the privacy debate. In addition to the passing of extensive consumer privacy protections in Europe, a series of breaches, hacks and the revelation of a number of distasteful tech privacy practices have completely changed the scope of the conversation. While the U.S. has yet to pass comprehensive privacy legislation — barring more ambitious attempts at the local and state level — the stage is set for the federal government to at least begin considering this monumental undertaking...</div>

						<div class="descample">On Sept. 12, New Mexico&#8217;s Attorney General Hector Balderas announced a lawsuit against a group of tech companies – including Google and Twitter – for jeopardizing children&#8217;s safety and privacy in ways that are in violation of child protection laws, including the Child Online Protection Act (COPPA).

The announcement has been met with mixed reception, given Facebook&#8217;s track record with privacy and online safety. Additionally, some experts have more general concerns regarding the effects of social media on children. But do these concerns have merit?</div>

						<div class="descample">Managing privacy settings is a key aspect of cybersecurity and arguably the first line of defense against cyberthreats. Many online services offer privacy controls in some form, but users don&#8217;t bother with them, don&#8217;t understand them or they don&#8217;t find them sufficient, leaving few satisfied with the status quo. Why is it so hard to get privacy right?</div>

						<div class="descample">For better or worse, some things never change. Unfortunately, that includes consumers&#8217; passwords. SplashData&#8217;s sixth annual worst passwords list has many of the same passwords from previous years, which proves that consumers either don&#8217;t care about their passwords or they aren&#8217;t too concerned about cybersecurity. We&#8217;ve covered SplashData&#8217;s lists before, and the unfortunate reality is that we&#8217;ve seen a lot of repeat offenders over the years — and the trend is continuing this year.</div>

But how much worse would it feel if the perpetrator was someone you knew and trusted? We tend to think of identity thieves as elite foreign hackers or dark web peddlers, but the truth is that there could be danger lurking closer to home. Although the statistics are debated, friend and family identity theft (or familiar fraud) does occur frequently – a Javelin Research and Study report noted that in 2014 there were 550,000 reports of identity theft perpetrated by someone the victim knew.</div>

						<div class="descample">In most people‘s lives, there will come a time when they‘ll have to borrow money. As burdensome as being in debt sounds, strategically acquired debt isn&#8217;t bad, and in some cases, might actually be useful. While being debt free is a goal many people have, you shouldn&#8217;t let this goal keep you from taking on debt entirely, as some debt may be able to help you. Financial experts frequently debate if there‘s truly such a thing as “good debt,” but while some people hesitate to use the term, most agree that debt can be acceptable and beneficial when handled responsibly. Below we discuss a few of the conditions that make debt arguably good.</div>

If you&#8217;re already planning one, chances are you&#8217;re making a checklist to help you pack and get your car road-ready. But something that can be easily overlooked when planning for a road trip is the limits of your auto insurance policy. Given how long you&#8217;ll be driving and the fact that your car is likely your only mode of transportation while you&#8217;re gone, you&#8217;ll want to make sure your policy is extensive enough to cover any incident that may occur.</div>

						<div class="descample">Searching for insurance can be a stressful process, as there are many things to consider. On top of the most-obvious concern of price, there&#8217;s the need to meet the insurer&#8217;s criteria. For those who have filed an auto insurance claim, it might seem as if past claim(s) follow you long after they&#8217;ve been closed. Why is that? Many insurance companies use a little-known database called C.L.U.E.® (Coverage Loss Underwriting Exchange), which is provided by LexisNexis — the same agency that teamed up with Equifax to announce a new FICO Score earlier this year.</div>

Other cohorts might similarly see increases in their rates of default over time, as well. With this issue shaping to be a crisis of epic proportions, we&#8217;ve decided to take a look at student loan servicers, specifically Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) and how the allegations currently plaguing the lender reflect on broader trends surrounding student loan repayment and the student loan industry...</div>

Indeed, your insurance company will not hesitate to decrease (or increase) your auto insurance rates as it deems necessary. The good news is, you don&#8217;t have to wait around for your insurance company to make changes — you can be on the lookout for auto insurance savings yourself.
